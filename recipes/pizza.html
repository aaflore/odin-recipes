<h2>Description</h2>

<p>New Yorkers pride themselves on three things: bagels, cheesecake, and, of course, their pizza. This homemade New York Style Pizza recipe captures the essence of NYC pizza without having to travel to the east coast! </p>
<p>This isn’t like a Neapolitan pizza—it has a thin, crisp crust, which is essential to a pizza if you ask anyone from the city. And the best part is, the dough is so easy to make! It’s made with super simple ingredients, too: I use bread flour (but you can use all-purpose flour as well), some sugar, some sea salt, instant yeast, and just some water and oil! </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>

    <li>Fresh Tomato Sauce</li>
    <li>Organic Cheese</li>
    <li>Pepperoni</li>
    <li>Sausage</li>
    <li>Dough</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>

    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees</li>
    <li>Roll out and prep dough</li>
    <li>Place sauce evenly on dough</li>
    <li>Cover sauce with cheese, pepperoni, and sausage</li>
    <li>Place in oven and leave for 45 minutes</li>
    <li>Take out of oven, let sit for 5 minutes and enjoy!</li>
    
</ol>
