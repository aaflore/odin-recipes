<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Like that perfectly worn-in sweater you never want to take off, a no-fail lasagna recipe is absolutely necessary to combat the colder months. All it takes is noodles, sauce and cheese, right? Turns out, it's not that easy to score an amazing batch.</p>
<p>After lots of research (and a fair amount of tasting), we discovered the five critical factors that separate great lasagna from a good one. Then we used that intel to build the (dare we say) perfect versionâ€”the one you'll want to make every single Sunday. Here are the secrets to the sauce (and noodles).</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>

    <li>Fresh Tomato Sauce</li>
    <li>Organic Cheese</li>
    <li>Ground Beef</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Lasagna noodles</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>

    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees</li>
    <li>Place lasagna noodles in tray</li>
    <li>Layer ground beef, cheese, and tomato sauce, followed by another layer of noodles</li>
    <li>Repeat until 4 layers</li>
    <li>Place in oven and leave for 45 minutes</li>
    <li>Take out of oven, let sit for 8 minutes and enjoy!</li>
    
</ol>
